function [normalised_matrix] = normMe(input_matrix)
    %NORMME Normalises a matrix to the maximum absolute value.
    %
    % DESCRIPTION
    %   NORMME(inputMatrix) takes a matrix or vector of any size, finds the
    %   absolute maximum value and normalized the vector. Therefore, the
    %   element with the largest absolute value is equal to 1.
    %
    % USEAGE
    %   normalised_matrix = normMe(input_matrix);
    %
    % INPUTS
